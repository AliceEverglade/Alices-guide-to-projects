Welcome to my vijf luik project which I named PentaMento. ~ (Penta is Greek/Latin for 5 and Mento comes from the latin word Memento meaning Memory.) ~ please scan this QR Code before proceeding. ~ it contains a folder with all the projects I will be talking about.

Sadly I did not make the project I was planning to make. ~ My plan was to make a website but I couldn’t muster up any motivation for that.

The Project I chose for Individuality was my Voice Assistant ‘Aico’. ~ This was the Ambition project at the start of the year  ~ where I (foolishly) decided to learn a new coding language.

I quickly noticed that I might’ve made this a bit too difficult for myself. ~ Though I really enjoy learning so I kept on trying to learn Python. ~ I asked a friend of mine to assist me with this and together we got it to work on a basic level.

What I learned from this project is that I shouldn’t make it too difficult for myself. ~ I set the bar too high for myself.

Though in my opinion that is the most fun way to approach a project. ~ Sadly I don’t have multiple months to finish something like that.

I do plan to come back to that project in the future to see if I can truly learn Python. ~ And then I can hopefully use the voice assistant.

The project I chose for Growth is my Shine Project. ~ Here I learned how to do Special Effects in Unity. ~ this was after the advice to not make it hard for myself, though again I did…

I started out by watching a tutorial on what I wanted to make, ~ Though most of the time when I understood what the tutorial said I just skipped to the next part. ~ My project was going smoothly.

Sadly since I am no artist or animator I had to use assets from the internet. ~ These assets did not cooperate very well and this halted my project.

After a lot of struggling I only had 1 special effect done. ~ The bar I set for myself of 3 special effects with animations was again, not reached.

Although it didn’t go as planned, I do feel confident in what I learned. ~ I think I am capable of making a shader or special effect in Unity without a tutorial.

The project I chose for Confidence was English writing. ~ I wrote a story about Alice and some of the characters of my friends. ~ The story was about working for an apparently corrupt king.

I enjoy writing a lot and even though it was cliche and corny I was still proud of it. ~ I do plan to do more writing in the future, and lots of worldbuilding too for my future games.

So I hope I will be able to learn how to make my stories more inviting.

The project I chose for fun was the Media Tour from Creativity. ~ I made this about my favorite game Celeste. ~ (I did this in English which was also very fun)

Celeste is a fairly well-known platformer game about climbing a strange mountain. ~ Though the story of Celeste delves more into fighting inner demons and learning to live with yourself.

For the project I take pride in I couldn’t decide. ~ I often have difficulty complimenting my own work as it can always be better. ~ Though my Social Connection project and WTF!/PentaMento (this one) were ones I do take some pride in.

For Social Connection I interviewed an online friend and asked them if I could make a game concept for them. ~ This game concept is something I plan to work out properly in a professional way. ~ Though it has changed a lot since the project ended.

The WTF project is the one I made PentaMento a part of. ~ I started this project on Monday the 13th of June and was hooked on the idea. ~ So much so that I changed my PentaMento from a website to this.

I load in text files with a certain layout. ~ Line 1 is the emotion of Alice, line 2 is the text, line 3 is the change in emotion depending on the answer, ~ And line 4 is the color of the text and box.

I worked hard on this project with the help of a friend who taught me new things about a coding language I thought I knew decently well. ~ This feels very fulfilling to me as I know this knowledge will work well in any future project.
